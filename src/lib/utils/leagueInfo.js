DFFL was created in part from the ashes of a long time league "The Players Club" and a core of Navy Information Dominators who worked (suffered?) together in Hawaii from 2009-2012 who then sucked in some of the biggest degenerates they have known from life and from other leagues over the years.

    About
  </a>
</p>
<p>
DFFL has evolved a format that consistently seeks to replicate an NFL GM experience.  It currently utilizes a half-PPR, Pt/1st Down, QB/RB/WRx2/TE/WRTx3/K/D format with salary caps, contracts, rookie draft, FA auction, and trading, along with bench and taxi (practice) options all meant to test a fantasy manager's skill and prowess.
</p>
<p>
There's also occasional side betting.
</p>
<p>
Between the action in Sleeper for league play, the social banter and discussion in What's App, and the blogs and data tracking in official league website and Google Drive, you'll be hard pressed to ever find a more complete fantasy football experience. 
Someday, we'll have either a Big Screen, Hallmark, or Netflix movie or series.
